This is, in some sense, the worst possible configuration, as it creates a background hum of stress, but is just sustainable enough that you can keep it up for years."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"My explanation for the universality of this <em>20% rule</em> is that it arises as a natural result of leaving knowledge workers to self-regulate their workload. It’s difficult for even the most organized and intentional among us to manage a constant influx of requests, and messages, and project proposals, and, God help us, Zoom meeting invites — so we default to a simple heuristic: start saying “no” when we feel stressed, as this provides psychological cover to retreat in an otherwise ambiguous terrain of never-ending potential labor."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The problem with this strategy, of course, is that we don’t start pulling back until <em>after</em> we have too much going on: leading to the 20% overload that’s so consistently observed."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The question left unexamined in my essay is what it would look like if you rejected this rule. What if, for example, you aimed to work 20% <em>less</em> than you had time to reasonably handle? If you have a relatively autonomous, entrepreneurial type job, this would mean saying “no” to more things. It would also mean, on the daily scale, being more willing to end early, or take an afternoon off to go do something unrelated, or extend lunch to read a frivolous book."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Here’s what I want to know: <strong>how much would this hurt you professionally?</strong> As I move deeper into my exploration of slow productivity, I’m starting to develop a sinking suspicion that the answer might be “not that much.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"If you worked deeply and regularly on a reasonable portfolio of initiatives that move the needle, and were sufficiently organized to keep administrative necessities from dropping through the cracks, your business probably wouldn’t implode, and your job roles would likely still be fulfilled. This shift from a state of slightly too much work to not quite enough, in other words, might be less consequential than we fear."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"<em>Or maybe not. </em>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The issue is that not enough people are asking these questions. We know the costs of consistently squeezing in those extra evening email replies, or pushing through that one last extra block on our time block schedule, but few have yet taken the time to really confront the supposed benefits. We care a lot about doing well with the work on our plate (as we should), but not nearly enough about asking how big that plate should be in the first place."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/09/01/revisiting-parkinsons-law/","title":"Revisiting Parkinson’s Law","date":"2021/09/01","content":[{"blockType":"image","src":"https://www.calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/parkinsons-law-640-px.png"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I first came across Parkinson’s Law in Tim Ferriss’s 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C71SLM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004C71SLM&amp;linkId=887b543966456cd582ccda25983ee2c9\"><em>The 4 Hour Workweek</em></a>. Ferriss summarized it as follows:"},{"blockType":"quote","textContent":"“Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Ferriss suggests that you should therefore schedule work with “very short and clear deadlines,” arguing that this will greatly reduce the time required to make progress on important tasks."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This advice is sound. After reading Ferriss’s book, <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/15/fixed-schedule-productivity-how-i-accomplish-a-large-amount-of-work-in-a-small-number-of-work-hours/\">I began to work backwards from a constrained schedule</a> — forcing&nbsp; my professional efforts to fit within these tight confines. As predicted by Parkinson’s Law, these restrictions don’t seem to decrease the quantity of projects on which I make progress. If anything, I seem to get more done than many&nbsp; who work more hours."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This is all prelude to me noting that I have fond feelings for Parkinson’s Law. Which is why I was so surprised when recently, as part of the research for <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/why-do-we-work-too-much\">my latest <em>New Yorker</em> essay</a>, I revisited <a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/economics/parkinsons-law/the-economist-article.pdf\">the original 1955 <em>Economist</em> article</a> that introduced the concept and found a whole other layer of meaning that I had previously missed."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Parkinson opens his essay with the pronouncement highlighted by Ferriss: “It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Parkinson then provides statistical evidence for this phenomenon, showing that the British naval bureaucracy <em>grew</em> even as the navy it served shrunk after WWI. &nbsp;He details an explanation for this counterproductive behavior that culminates in (satirically) precise mathematical formulas, e.g.,:"},{"blockType":"image","src":"https://www.calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/parkinson-formula-640px.png"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The details of his explanation are less important than its general implication: in the absence of strict direction, work systems can self-regulate in unusual ways. The British bureaucracies Parkinson studied grew according to internal dynamics that had little to do with the work they were meant to execute. They became their own beings with their own objectives."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Ferriss popularized the&nbsp;<em>personal</em> version of Parkinson’s Law, which correctly notes that our work expands to fill the time we give it. The original <em>Economist</em> essay on the topic also embeds an <em>organizational</em> version of the law, which I read to say that if you leave a group, or a team, or a company to operate without sufficient structure, they may converge toward unexpected and unproductive behaviors. Indeed, the hyperactive hive mind I popularized in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536558/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0525536558&amp;linkId=94b93cce172e2021d92db16d0e8dc83b\"><em>A World Without Email</em></a> can be seen as a 21st century instantiation of&nbsp; the organizational variant of Parkinson’s Law."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The mark of a good polemic is the ability for its readers to extract multiple layers of productive meaning. By this measure, we must admit, Parkinson wrote one hell of an essay."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/08/17/on-the-pandemic-and-career-downsizing/","title":"On the Pandemic and Career Downsizing","date":"2021/08/17","content":[{"blockType":"image","src":"https://www.calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/quitting-640px.png"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Earlier this summer, the Labor Department released a report that included a shocking statistic: close to 4 million people had quit or resigned in April.

There are many different factors powering the Great Resignation, and it impacts many different demographics. Amidst this complexity there was one thread in particular that I pulled: highly-educated knowledge workers leaving their jobs not because the pandemic presented obstacles, but because it instead nudged them to rethink the role of work in their lives."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As I elaborate in the piece, I was able to find insight for this “career downsizing” trend in one of my favorite works of American philosophy, Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em>. This book is often misunderstood as an ode to simplicity and the beauty of nature.

I’m only up to page 190 (which is to say, only up to Isaac Newton), but even early on I’ve become intrigued by a repeated observation:&nbsp;though the scientists profiled in Gribbin’s book are highly “productive” by any intuitive definition of this term, <strong>the <em>daily </em><em>pace</em> of their work was incredibly slow </strong>by any modern standards of professional effectiveness."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Galileo probably had his famed insight about the period of a pendulum in 1584, while a medical student in Pisa, observing swinging chandeliers in the cathedral.

Yet results are what he did ultimately produce."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"During Newton’s tenure at Cambridge, to cite another example, the university was closed for multiple years at a time due to plague epidemics.&nbsp; Though Newton later claimed that his thinking on gravity was stimulated by a falling apple observed during these forced idyls, Gribbins argues that his main insights came later. These early enlightenment-era shutdowns really did likely shutdown a lot of the young professor’s work."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"It wasn’t until 1680, after an extended detour into alchemy, that Newton was spurred by a letter from a colleague to work out a formal understanding of what became the inverse square law that governs gravity. It then took until 1684 before he got around to publishing a nine-page version of this argument. It was yet another three years before this thinking expanded into his epic <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, the most important book in the history of science."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Returning to my original insight, the message I extracted from these historical encounters is that when it comes to our understanding of productivity, <em>timescale matters</em>."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"When viewed at the fast scale of days and weeks, the famed scientists in Gribbin’s book seem spectacularly unproductive. Years would pass during which little progress was made on epic theories.

He was working with his colleagues to try to find a more efficient method for solving a large class of wave equations. “We spent every day drawing on blackboards and chasing one wrong idea after another,” he writes. Frustrated, he left the session to go for a run on a tree-lined path.

The top performers in my field are smart, to be sure, but their the real advantage is less some supercharged brain that delivers fully-formed proofs in effortless bursts, than it is a supercharged work ethic: an ability to stick with mastering hard results from the literature; building the mental frameworks, one arduous level after another, on which the eventual insights can then find purchase."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I don’t have a sweeping big think conclusion to draw from these observations.

The engines turned overhead shafts, which were connected by an intricate array of belts and pulleys to close-packed machinery. When electric motors were first introduced, factory owners tried to integrate them into their existing setups; often, they’d simply replace the hulking steam engine with a giant electric dynamo. This introduced some conveniences—no one had to shovel coal—but also created complexities.

With these first two novels I was only able to write in spurts, snatching bits of time here and there — a half hour here, an hour there — and because I was always tired and felt like I was competing against the clocks as I wrote, I was never able to concentrate.

At the other extreme, you might deploy a fully geeked out, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done\">productivity pr0n-style optimized collection of tools</a> to precisely prioritize your obligations."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"To make sense of these varied journeys from a broad array of potential activity to the narrowed scope of actual execution, I often imagine the three-level funnel diagramed above."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The funnel begins with the fundamental task of <strong>selection,</strong> where you determine which activities to commit to accomplish. Relevant ideas for this level can be found in books like <em>First Things First,</em> <em>Essentialism</em>, <em>How to Do Nothing</em>, <em>One Thing</em>, <em>The Dip</em>, and <em>Year of Yes</em>."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Once committed, these activities must then go through processing, <strong>organization</strong>, and storage. There are two goals for this funnel level: to avoid forgetting what you’re supposed to do, and to make smart decisions about what to work on next. Relevant ideas for this level can be found in books like <em>Getting Things Done </em>and <em>The Bullet Journal Method. </em>This is also where the Capture/Configure/Control philosophy I talk about on my podcast, or software like OmniFocus, Trello, Basecamp, and Asana, can help."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The final level focuses on the actual <strong>execution</strong> of whatever it is you’ve figure out you should be doing in the moment. This includes how you plan your day, the rituals you deploy to support your efforts, and the processes you’ve put in place to support more effective collaboration with others. Relevant ideas for this level can be found in books like <em>Deep Work</em>,&nbsp;<em>A World Without Email,</em> <em>Daily Rituals</em>, <em>The War of Art</em>, and <em>Bird by Bird. </em>Planning tools like my <em><a href=\"https://www.timeblockplanner.com/\">Time Block Planner</a>&nbsp;</em>are also useful here."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"There are obvious benefits to defining the concept of productivity with this level of detail."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"For one thing, it helps avoid the common mistake of focusing on one part of the funnel while avoiding others. There are many deep work aficionados, for example, who are obsessive about their depth rituals (execution), but are constantly forgetting or losing track of what’s on their plate (organization)."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Similarly, it’s common to come across productivity geeks with complex organizational systems, who pay little attention to their overall workload (selection), and end up hopelessly overwhelmed, no matter how much they optimize their OmniFocus configuration."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"By clearly delineating the three different levels of the productivity funnel, you can make sure each level gets at least some attention."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This detailed definition also adds nuance to anti-productivity criticism. A lot of this recent debate loosely associates the term “productivity” with an exploitative capitalist drive to maximize accomplishment. When viewed against the specificity of the productivity funnel, however, it becomes clear that this critique more accurately concerns only the activity selection level."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I agree that there’s an important debate to be had about how organizations and individuals implement activity selection (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/04/07/on-slow-productivity-and-the-anti-busyness-revolution/\">my recent post on <em>slow productivity</em></a>), but regardless of where this debate takes us, the other levels of the funnel remain important and largely orthogonal. In a post-capitalist collectivist utopia, where work is optional, and we’ve excised our souls of our past bourgeois internalization of the narratives of production, we’ll <em>still</em> have things we need to get done, and having an organizational system will <em>still</em> be better than haphazardly trying to keep track of these things in our minds (<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/x03.htm\">even Lenin had a task list</a>)."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Similarly, intentionality about execution can often enhance — not impede — slower lifestyles. If you don’t give serious thought to how you want to structure your days, it’s all too easy to fall back into distraction and shallow busyness."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I’m not sure if the funnel proposed above is complete. Indeed, I’m almost certainly missing aspects of productivity that are equally as important as the three levels I detail. But the more general movement here toward clarity in what we mean when we talk about productivity is worth encouraging."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/04/07/on-slow-productivity-and-the-anti-busyness-revolution/","title":"On Slow Productivity and the Anti-Busyness Revolution","date":"2021/04/07","content":[{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Seven years ago, Alex Soojung-Kim Pang was a typical overworked, multitasking, slave to the hyperactive hive mind, Silicon Valley consultant.&nbsp; Feeling the symptoms of burnout intensify, he arranged a three-month sabbatical at Microsoft Research Cambridge. Here’s how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less\">he later described</a> this period:"},{"blockType":"quote","textContent":"“I got an enormous amount of stuff done and did an awful lot of really serious thinking, which was a great luxury, but I also had what felt like an amazingly leisurely life. I didn’t feel the constant pressure to look busy or the stress that I had when I was consulting. And it made me think that maybe we had this idea about the relationship between working hours and productivity backward. And [we should] make more time in our lives for leisure in the classic Greek sense.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The experience led him to ultimately publish a book titled,&nbsp;<em>Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less.</em> I remember this book because it came out the same year as&nbsp;<em>Deep Work</em>, and the two volumes were often paired as variations on a common emerging anti-busyness theme."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In the half-decade that has since transpired, an increasing number of new books have taken aim at our accelerating slide toward overload in both our work and our personal lives. Many of these new titles, somewhat in contrast to my writing, or that of Pang,&nbsp; have adopted a more strident and polemical tone — not only underscoring the issues, but also pointing a defiant finger at the forces which are supposedly to blame. Clearly the overwhelmed and overscheduled manner in which we currently operate isn’t working."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Which brings me to a question that more and more has been capturing my attention: <em>What can we do about this unfortunate state of affairs?</em>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"It’s here that the insightful work that has probed this question in recent years falls somewhat short of sparking major change. The genre is currently dominated by economic materialist arguments: We work too much because of exploitive capitalist imperatives, and then overload our personal lives because we’ve internalized these narratives."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"There is, of course, a subversive, trapdoor energy in this materialism that’s not entirely misguided: there <em>are</em> many areas in which a constant scrutiny of labor relations is warranted, and the allure of consumerist affluence <em>is</em> far from benign. But a pure materialist interpretation of overload culture severely limits our responses, leaving us, if you’ll excuse some mild facetiousness, with only the option to occasionally engage in non-instrumental activities as an act of resistance while waiting for others to overthrow the capitalist market economy."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"<em>I believe&nbsp;we can do more right now.</em>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"My thinking in this area is still half-formed, but I’ve become increasingly convinced that what this conversation needs are <em>alternative</em> definitions of “productivity”; definitions that believably deliver on the promises of profitable value generation in businesses and resilient satisfaction in our personal lives, while rendering the excesses of overload culture as unnecessary at best, and profoundly harmful at worse."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In my research on such matters, I’ve come to learn that a lot about how we work and live right now is more ungrounded and arbitrary than many might assume, driven more by a novel mix of autonomy and ambiguity than deterministic dynamics of exploitation. We may need a <em>slow productivity</em> revolution more than we need an economic revolution."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I don’t know exactly what these new definitions of productivity might look like, but we can certainly do better than our current haphazard approaches, in which work descends into performative busyness on Slack, and our personal lives are digested into air-brushed social media moments. The human attraction toward some notion of productivity isn’t the problem.

I would stop by to talk about productivity and focus, and when possible, grab a free lunch."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Attending these bootcamps, I was often struck by how much the conversation centered on “writing.” The informal advice passed around was about “getting in your writing hours,” or making sure “to write every day,” or committing to “hit your target word count.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I always found this somewhat confusing, as my experience with writing — both popular and academic — matched Hemingway’s self-description, in that the actual act of putting words on the page came only after many more hours&nbsp; spent thinking through what I wanted to say.

Why are we suddenly spending so much more time in meetings now that we’re working from home? There are multiple factors involved."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"For example, the sudden shift out of the office created a lot of unexpected new questions that had to be answered. In the moment, scheduling a meeting is an easy way to relieve the anxiety of having these new and pressing demands on your plate."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"(Remember: the one productivity system that is universally trusted is the calendar, so if a meeting related to a new issue is scheduled, you can trust that it won’t be forgotten, and you therefore no longer have to keep track of it in your head. This grants immediate relief.)"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Another factor is a reduction in the energy and social capital expended when organizing online gatherings. Pre-pandemic, setting up a meeting meant reserving a conference room and requiring your colleagues to physically relocate themselves at your request. There’s enough of a cost here that you might think twice before casually convening these conversations."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In a remote setting, however, we’re all just on our laptops all day anyway, so the cost of shooting off a digital calendar invite for a Zoom discussion is much lower. It takes only a couple clicks and the social consequences seem minimal. The result: we setup many more meetings."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This brings us to the question of how to reduce this overload, and therefore back to the idea of reverse meetings. Here’s the concept:"},{"blockType":"unordered-list","listItems":["Everyone maintains regular office hours: set times each week during which they’re always available via video conference, chat, and phone. During these times you can digitally stop by and chat without a prior appointment.

Consider, for example, a hypothetical scenario where I need to make a decision on a new marketing campaign and need feedback from five of my coworkers. The easy solution is to schedule a meeting to discuss. Let’s say it takes about an hour. This eliminates six people hours —&nbsp; 360 total minutes — of potential attention."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In a reverse meeting scenario, by contrast, I might take only 10 minutes from each colleague, taking up 50 minutes total of my time, and 50 minutes total of their time, for an overall demand of 100 minutes of attention, which is 3.6 times less cost."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As an added bonus, the reverse meeting also reverses the asymmetric consequences of these gatherings. It is now significantly more costly to <em>initiate</em> a meeting than it is to <em>attend</em>. The result? Less meetings are convened in the first place."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"There are, of course, many scenarios where this approach doesn’t work, and there are many other strategies that might also help reduce meeting overload. (Another favorite of mine is the <strong>meeting quota</strong>: each person has three afternoon slots every day for meetings, and that’s it; so once you’ve filled the slots for a given day you have to move on to another day, enforcing an artificial scarcity on collaborative attention and ensuring enough focus is left over for other types of work.)"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The broader point, however, is that we need to respond to the current moment with more radical thinking about how we organize our work.

He closed his law office, sold his house, and moved to the woods of Marin County. Seven years later he published <em>The Language of the Law</em> (1963), the book by which he will be chiefly remembered.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In 1956, at the moment when Mellinkoff decided to retreat into the woods, his decision to trade all the busyness, urgency, and, of course, remuneration of running a Beverly Hills law firm for the monasticism of Marin must have seemed shockingly unproductive.

But I also find that there are different types of tasks. The easiest to deal with are what I’m taking to calling ‘concrete’ tasks, such as taking out the rubbish, or submitting a final report. These are defined, necessary tasks that are cognitively easy to deal with. However, I’m also aware of ‘aspirational’ tasks, such as ‘summarize <em>War and Peac</em>e,’ which are open-ended, and don’t really matter if you accomplish them by a specific time…they tend to just pile up.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This is an important question because it touches on the rare productivity topic that’s both crucial to my personal process, and something that I haven’t already written much about.

In GTD, you might have a list of broader “projects,” such as Nathan’s example of summarizing Tolstoy, but these are just reminders that should spur you to add relevant next actions to your task list during your next review; perhaps, in this case, “buy notebook for book summary,” or “read the next 10 pages.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As I told Nathan, I do not strictly subscribe to this philosophy of task essentialism. For me, some projects are never translated into tasks. Instead, I place them on my quarterly plan. I’ll then see the project when setting up my weekly plan. At this point, I work out what progress, if any, I want to make on it during the upcoming week.

I instead treat them with the level of intention that their formidable difficulty deserves."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This distinction between <em>tasks</em> and <em>projects</em> is subtle, but it’s also critical to how I think about my work, so I thought it was worth discussing as we enter a new year and begin pondering how to make the most out of this annual return to a proverbial clean slate."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/12/29/theodore-roosevelts-focused-advice/","title":"Theodore Roosevelt’s Focused Advice","date":"2020/12/29","content":[{"blockType":"image","src":"https://www.calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roosevelt-640px.jpeg"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"One of my colleagues at Georgetown recently pointed me toward <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Letters-His-Children-Biographical-Introduction-ebook/dp/B000FC1ZTS\">a 1902 letter</a> that Theodore Roosevelt sent to his son Kermit, who at the time was at boarding school."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Here’s the passage that caught my attention:"},{"blockType":"quote","textContent":"“I am delighted at all the accounts I receive of how you are doing at Groton.

You can’t leave the walled garden, because everything you care about is locked inside."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"But in a scheme like the one proposed here, the locks are opened. If you don’t like Twitter’s addictive interface, or the outrage-inducing Tweets its algorithms push into your timeline, you can jump over to another service that doesn’t try to addict you; perhaps one that charges a modest subscription fee and instead curates a timeline of “deep thoughts” on selected topics, or shows you only the best or most originally twisted comedic memes of the day."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"If we want to follow this train of thought to its radical but rational terminus, one might even imagine a publicly-funded technology consortium that stores all social links and all data posted or received on this social graph. In this scenario, <em>every</em> service works with the same public database, forcing them to compete only on the experience and value they bring to their users."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"When you’re not trapped in the garden, in other words, you’re not compelled to put up with abuse."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"To be fair, I can already think of a dozen issues with this particular, admittedly sketchy proposal.

Too many of the “solutions” proposed for the moral calamities induced by existing social media platforms focus on directly forcing those platforms to behave better."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"But if we owned our social internet destiny, we wouldn’t need Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, or (God forbid) Tik Tok,&nbsp; to behave better.

This casual approach has you fill the time between scheduled meetings and calls reacting to emails and occasionally, when the mood hits you, trying to make progress on items plucked from an unwieldy task list.","The <strong>time blocking</strong> method, by contrast, has you partition your days into blocks of time and assign specific work to these blocks. Maybe, for example, you’re working on a strategy memo from 9:00 to 10:00, then after a 10:00 to 10:30 meeting you put aside thirty minutes for checking email, followed by ninety-minutes, from 11:00 to 12:30, when you’ll try to complete a project report that’s due soon, and so on. Every minute gets a job.&nbsp; (What if you get knocked off your schedule by an unexpected crisis or task that takes longer than expected? Not a problem. You just build an updated time block schedule for the remainder of the day the next time you get a chance. The key is maintaining <em>intention</em> about your time, not <em>perfection</em> in your planning.)"]},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"There are two problems with the list/reactive method. First, because you’re letting other peoples’ needs drive your activities, the balance between the urgent and the important becomes skewed. You feel busy and exhausted, but you’re not really moving the needle on the things that matter."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Second, because you have no plan beyond just “trying to get things done,” it’s easy for your mind to keep deciding it needs ad hoc internet “breaks,” which have a way of transforming into time-devouring rabbit holes. This decreases the total amount of work you’re able to accomplish."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Time blocking, by contrast, gives you fine-grained control over the balance between the urgent and the important. In addition, because you know what you’re supposed to be doing at any given moment, you’re much less likely to take unplanned breaks. Time blockers, in other words, don’t web surf."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This scheduling commitment also provides you hard evidence on how much time you really have available, and how long things really take. This reality check can be bracing at first, but ultimately it’s crucial. It leads to a more vigorous essentialism (e.g., <a href=\"https://gregmckeown.com/episodes/episode/cal-newport-on-unplugging-the-static/\">as I recently discussed on Greg McKeown’s podcast</a>), and more conservatism on how early you start projects."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"A word of warning, however, is that this strategy is cognitively demanding. Part of the reason time blockers get so much more done is because their average intensity of focus is quite high compared to their semi-distracted peers. Such concentration, however, takes a toll. So you do <em>not</em> want to extend this blocking discipline to your time outside of work, as this excessive rigidity will eventually lead to burn out."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Escaping from the noise of a distracted world and becoming reacquainted with the pleasures of presence and concentration are crucial preconditions to a focused life. To achieve this state in full, however, ultimately requires that you take the final step of actually focusing your attention with intention and purpose."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Time block planning will move you in this direction. It’s important to note that it’s not enough by itself. A life of focus also needs, for example, regular time to reflect about <em>what</em> to focus on in your work, and a more serious commitment to directing your free time toward higher quality and more rewarding activities. Beyond these concerns, solitude is important, as is aggressive community engagement and cultivating high quality leisure."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"But time blocking will set the needed tone; a signal to yourself that you take seriously how you direct your newly empowered attention."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"####"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"If you’re looking to go beyond the advice offered in this Focus Week series, and take even more radical action toward reclaiming your life from the forces of distraction, then I invite you to stay tuned to find out more about <em>Life of Focus</em>, the new online course that I co-created with Scott Young."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The course takes students through a three-month, guided training.

This is an important topic that I haven’t talked a lot about before, so I thought it might be useful to sharpen and elaborate the answer I gave on my show."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In the office setting, most delegation occurs over email. You need something done that you either don’t have the time to do, or don’t want to do, or don’t know how to do: so you shoot off a quick message to put in on someone else’s plate. Our current <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed\">moment of remote work</a> has made these electronic hand-offs even more frequent."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As I explained on my podcast, however, I think this is a problem. You’d probably be better off if you instead worked backward from a simple rule that will make your life more annoying in the short term, but significantly more productive in the long term: <strong>don’t delegate using email.</strong>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Before we discuss how this is even possible, let’s touch on why it’s important."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"When handing off tasks, email’s extreme efficiency can become a liability. It nudges you toward temporary relief of psychic discomfort. You think of something that you don’t want to forget, so you dash off an email: <em>look into this and get back to me!</em> Something new arrives in your inbox, creating a brief moment of obligation — <em>oh no, something else I have to make time for</em> — that can be dispelled with a quick forward of the message to a colleague."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I call this relief temporary, however, because you haven’t actually dissipated the discomfort. A quickly composed, ambiguous delegation email only passes this discomfort onto its recipient, perhaps even <em>increasing</em> the distress, as you’ve likely left out details clear to you, but not to the person grappling with your hasty missive. To make matters worse, this ambiguity will then require many more additional back-and-forth messages to try to approximate some clarity, further multiplying and spreading the cognitive toll of the original task."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"When you instead enforce a simple <em>no email delegation</em> rule, this instinct to sacrifice the greater good for a smaller personal respite is stymied. Solutions that are overall more productive suddenly become necessary."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"On my podcast, for example, I talk a lot about task board software, like Trello, Flow, or Asana. Instead of allowing tasks to exist implicitly among emails buried in an inbox, why not instead isolate and clarify them as standalone cards on a virtual task board? Now it’s clear who is supposed to be working on what, and all the information relevant to a given task can be appended to its card, instead of fracturing itself among impromptu email threads."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The person doing the delegation must now clarify what exactly they’re delegating. When creating a new card for a task, as opposed to dashing off a message, you’re forced to actually think through and articulate exactly what it is you want, when you need it, and what information will be required to get there."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"These tasks boards also make it difficult to escape exactly <em>how much</em> you’re asking someone to do. It’s easy to shoot off a dozen emailed requests to a colleague throughout a busy day without thinking much about it. But when you instead see each card piled on top of another in that person’s column on a task board, the magnitude of what you’ve dispensed is unavoidable."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"For quick tasks that arrive in the form of emails, I’ve also found ticketing systems to be useful. This allows messages to be transformed into tickets that can be assigned to specific team members, appended with notes, and labeled with their current status. This is how, for example, in my capacity as the Director of Graduate Studies for my department at Georgetown, I coordinate incoming email issues with my Graduate Program Manager (we use FreshDesk)."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I can tell you from personal experience that the extra hassle in the moment of moving questions and requests into this system is absolutely worth it. The added structure of the ticketing system significantly reduces stress as compared to the alternative of attempting to juggle all of these obligations through an amorphous and ever-increasing tangle of undifferentiated emails."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I don’t want to fall too far down a productivity process rabbit hole here. My main observation is that when it comes to delegation, don’t be seduced by the promise of a temporary fix to the momentary crisis of having something new to wrangle. Email doesn’t have&nbsp;<em>enough</em> friction. It’s better to embrace a more structured system for identifying, describing, assigning and reviewing tasks that trades slightly more work right now for a significantly decreased cognitive toll for your organization in the future."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/08/05/on-the-subtle-network-science-of-optimal-office-communication/","title":"On the Subtle Network Science of Optimal Office Communication","date":"2020/08/05","content":[{"blockType":"image","src":"https://www.calnewport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/network-640px.jpg"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Consider the following workplace scenario.

They used a round-based agent simulation and focused on the NK problem space, a set of abstract problems, introduced by evolutionary biologist Stuart Kauffman, in which “solutions” are modeled as sequence of numbers, and nearby solutions (e.g, those that differ by only a small number of changes) have at most small differences in their fitness values. This creates a “rugged landscape” where you might have to explore worse answers to get to better options."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Lazer and Friedman assumed that individuals were “myopic,” meaning that in a given round they could only examine solutions that were slightly different than their best known current solution. They can also, however, explore their neighbors in the network and discover their best solutions, adopting them if better than their own."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"They then studied how different network structures impacted the quality of the best solution arrived at in the network as a whole. To return to our original example, they wanted to know what type of communication network would lead our hypothetical engineers to the best possible outcome."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Here’s a crude summary of their otherwise complex results:"},{"blockType":"unordered-list","listItems":["Well-connected networks, in which information flows quickly, arrive at pretty good solutions fast, but then get stuck.","Poorly-connected networks, in which information flows slowly, arrive at much better final solutions, but it takes longer.","This trade-off between quality of final solution and speed at which solutions are reached can be tuned by taking a poorly-connected network and then adding more and more shortcuts to the information flows."]},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The underlying dynamic behind these results is easy to understand. In a poorly-connected network, more solutions are being examined in parallel before the best of the bunch is able to spread enough to enforce a consensus. In the well-connected network, the first reasonable idea quickly takes over."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I mention this paper to underscore an important reminder. We should be cautious about any early confidence that the way we work today is in any sense optimal. Hooking everyone up to low-friction digital communication channels and telling them to <em>rock n’ roll</em> is flexible, convenient, and cheap.

Longtime readers of mine know that his work greatly influenced me. I never met Anders in person, but we shared a sporadic correspondence that I cherished. I thought it appropriate to offer a brief personal tribute to his powerful ideas."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Anders tackled the fundamental question of how experts get really good at what they do. The framework he proposed, which clarified a lot of confusion in the field at the time, introduced these two big ideas (among others):"},{"blockType":"ordered-list","listItems":["<strong>When trying to get better at a skill, an effort called “deliberate practice” is most effective.</strong> Deliberate practice, which aims to isolate areas that need improvement and then stretch you past your comfort zone to induce growth, is the critical activity that helps individuals move past amateur status in many endeavors, both physical and cognitive.","<strong>To reach an expert level often requires <em>a lot</em> of deliberate practice.</strong> In some of Anders’s more engaging studies, he would sift through accounts of so-called “prodigies”, and identify, time and again, prodigious quantities of deliberate practice surreptitiously squeezed into their early childhood years. As his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/science/anders-ericsson-dead.html\"><em>New York Times</em> obituary</a> recalls, Anders once summarized this finding as follows in an interview: “This idea that somebody more or less discovers, suddenly, that they’re extremely good at something, I’ve yet to find even a single example of that type of phenomenon.”"]},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I first came across Anders’s work in Geoff Colvin’s 2008 book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842948/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1591842948&amp;linkId=c98ec536b813efaaae40e3464a4f47e6\">Talent is Overrated</a>,</em> which blew my mind, and led to a deep dive into deliberate practice theory. It provided an antidote to an increasingly frenetic, digital-mediated world, where everyone was trying to find their passion or seek to somehow transmute social media busyness into accomplishment. It explained a lot about what seemed to resonate for me when I reflected on my own life, or surveyed those I admired around me at MIT or in the biographies of big thinkers I was devouring at the time."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The theory laid the foundations in my own writing for the idea that the <em>type</em> of work you’re doing matters (elaborated in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1455586692&amp;linkId=a9e4f377622b59f362983d4144a39d58\"><em>Deep Work</em></a>), and that meaningful accomplishment often requires the diligent application of such efforts over a long period of time (elaborated in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1455509124&amp;linkId=ff188a704ae26a007cbb9fa32f32b6eb\"><em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em></a>.)"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As with many big theories, the implications of Anders’s ideas were sometimes pushed to unsustainable extremes.

(Anders may have egged Gladwell on, as Anders was known to enjoy advancing extreme versions of his theories; though given the good-natured manner with which he approached subsequent debate, I always suspected that this tendency was in part driven by a Socratic impulse to generate progress through the dialectical clash of opposing conceptions.)"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In recent years, deliberate practice theory has continued to evolve. Most contemporary thinking on expert performance includes factors beyond just practice accumulation to understand high achievement, such as trainability, innate physiological advantage, and the complex and murky psychological cocktail we often summarize as “drive.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"There’s also an increased consideration of the&nbsp;<em>type</em> of skill being mastered. If there are clear cut rules and feedback, like when learning chess or golf, the application and advantages of deliberate practice are clear. In other pursuits, however, such as the ambiguous, semi-creative, semi-administrative efforts that define knowledge work, designing appropriate practice can be maddeningly difficult and its rewards less immediately obvious. (Though, as I argue in <em>So Good</em>, this is a challenge worth undertaking, as its difficulty scares most people off, leaving a huge competitive advantage for the few willing to apply a deliberate approach to their office-bound skills.)"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In the end, however, Anders’s key ideas — that the type and quantity of practice matters a lot — remain widely accepted. He transformed our understanding of the world from a frustratingly unobtainable vision in which people stumbled into their prodigious talent and lived happily ever after, into a more democratized and tractable reality; one in which your abilities are mutable, and disciplined diligence — <a href=\"https://thedanplan.com/\">though perhaps unable to transform you into the next Tiger Woods</a> — will almost always push your skills to a place where they can do you some real good."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Anders will be missed.

I have a lot of thoughts on this issue, but in my response I focused on one point in particular that I’ve been toying with recently: <strong>Facebook may have accidentally developed a fatal flaw.</strong>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"To understand this claim, we have to rewind to the early days of this social platform. The original pitch for Facebook was that it made it easier to connect online with people you knew. The content model was simple: you setup a profile, people you knew setup profiles, and everyone could then check each others’ vacation pictures and relationship statuses."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"For this model to be valuable, the people you knew had to also use the service. This is why Mark Zuckerberg focused at first on college campuses. These were closed communities in which it was easy to build up enough critical user mass to make Facebook fun."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Once Facebook moved into the range of hundreds of millions of users, competition became difficult. The value of a network with a hundred million users was exponentially larger than one with a million, as the former was much more likely to connect you with the people you cared about. It was on the strength of this model that Facebook emerged as a powerful social internet monopoly."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"<em>The problem, however, was that they weren’t making enough money.</em>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As their IPO loomed, Facebook executives feared that the appeal of checking the profiles of friends and family wasn’t strong enough to get people to use the service all day long. It was an activity you would occasionally do when bored; they needed to find a way to make their platform stickier."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"So Facebook did something radical: it blew up its original content model and replaced it with something novel: the bottomless scrolling newsfeed. Instead of checking the profiles of friends and family, you now encounter a stream of articles sourced from all over the network, handpicked by optimized statistical algorithms to push your buttons and stoke the fires of the elusive quality known as engagement."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Facebook shifted from connection to distraction; an entertainment giant built on content its users produced for free."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This shift was massively profitable because it significantly increased the time Facebook’s gigantic user base spent on the platform each day. Tapping that blue and gray icon on your phone now promised instant satisfaction, and our days are filled with endless moments were such appeasement is welcome."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The thought that keeps capturing my attention, however, is that perhaps in making this short term move toward increased profit, Facebook set itself up for long term trouble."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"When this platform shifted from connection to distraction it abdicated its greatest advantage: <em>network effects</em>. If Facebook’s main pitch is that it’s entertaining, it must then compete with everything else that’s entertaining. This includes podcasts, and YouTube, and streaming video services, not to mention niche <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/07/17/blurring-offline-and-online-more-on-the-potential-of-long-tail-social-media/\"><em>long tail social media</em></a> platforms that can’t offer you access to your old roommate, but can connect you with a small number of people who are interested in the same things as you. Meanwhile the social interactions that <em>used</em> to occur on these platforms have moved to more flexible and simpler mediums, like group text messages. Facebook used to be the place where grandparents sought new baby pictures. Today, these images are just as likely to be spread in a nondescript&nbsp; iMessage thread, with no creepy data mining or malicious attention engineering required."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I’m not so sure that a newsfeed made up of posts and links generated by random social media users can compete with this increasingly optimized world of targeted entertainment and streamlined digital socialization. Facebook found a way to grow to a market capitalization of $600 billion, but may have accidentally crippled itself in the process."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"<em>Or not</em>. But one thing I know for sure is that it would be myopic to believe that the future of social media is going to look just like it does today."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/06/15/small-steps/","title":"Small Steps","date":"2020/06/15","content":[{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Last week, I asked for your help in identifying organizations that have had some success working on issues surrounding police violence."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"My instinct when facing an overwhelming problem is to find at least one place where some improvement is possible, find people who are having success with these improvements, then give them support to help them keep going.&nbsp; Such steps are small in the short term, but they have a way of breaking the complacency of standing still, which in the long term can end up making the difference between transformation or frustration."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Over 60 of you sent me notes, pointed me toward organizations, and provided reading lists.

I didn’t claim that passion was a problem, but instead argued that it was too simplistic to assume that the key to career satisfaction was as easy as matching your job to a pre-existing inclination. For many people, this slogan might actually <em>impede</em> their progress down the more complicated path that leads to true satisfaction."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"One of the interesting things I uncovered in my research was that the term “follow your passion” didn’t really emerge in the context of career advice until the 1980s. Where did it come from? I argued that two critical trends converged during this period."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"First, the unionized industrial work that characterized mid-century American economic growth gave way to a less rooted knowledge sector. Workers who might have previously taken a job at whatever factory happened to be located in their hometown might now be forced to travel cross-country in search of a suitable office position."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"For the first time, the question of&nbsp;<em>what</em> you wanted to do for a living became pervasive — a shift captured well by the emergence in the early 1970s of Richard Bolles’ seminal career guide, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984856561/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1984856561&amp;linkId=07447dee22a90bf3dcece4353cae00d5\">What Color is Your Parachute</a>: </em>one of the original books to help readers identify which professions suit their personality and interests. It’s important to remember that this was a radical notion. “[At the time,] the idea of doing a lot of pen-and-paper exercises in order to take control of your career was regarded as a dilettante’s exercise,” <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/37499/what-happened-your-parachute\">Bolles later explained</a>."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"The second force at play was Joseph Campbell, the polymath literature professor who was heavily influenced by Carl Jung, and popularized <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577315936/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1577315936&amp;linkId=8dc7a264b2bf67790ed7eec80f217b91\">the hero’s journey</a> as a foundational mythology that emerges in many cultures. In 1988, PBS aired <a href=\"https://billmoyers.com/content/ep-1-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-the-hero%E2%80%99s-adventure-audio/\">a multi-part interview with Campbell hosted by Bill Moyers</a>. This wildly popular series introduced the concept of <em>following your bliss</em>, which Campbell, who read Sanskrit,&nbsp; had adapted from the ancient Hindu notion of <em>ananda</em>, or rapture."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Combine these two forces — a sudden need to figure out what you wanted to do for a living with Campbell’s mantra — and a strange, secularized, bastardized hybrid emerges: the key to career happiness, we decided as the 80s gave way to the 90s, was to <em>follow your passion</em>."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I was reminded of this history as I recently began reading Stephen Cope’s engaging treatise, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553386077/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0553386077&amp;linkId=aac99755049b454052f100605d2578e1\"><em>The Great Work of Your Life</em> </a>&nbsp;(hat tip to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/find-your-true-calling/\">Brett McKay</a>).&nbsp; In this book, Cope dives deep into the classic Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, which tackles the centrality of ananda, and was almost certainly an influence on Campbell’s blissful bromide."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Cope notes that this text indeed argues for the importance of discovering one’s <em>dharma</em> (calling), and giving it full commitment. What caught my attention, however, was the complexity Cope ascribes to this notion. In the ancient context in which the Bhagavad Gita was first composed, dharma was not something you identified through soul searching about what really lights your fire. As Cope writes:"},{"blockType":"quote","textContent":"“In the caste system of ancient India, dharmas were prescribed at birth. Arjuna [one of the two main characters of the Gita] was born into the warrior class. So, he was destined to be a warrior. It was his sacred duty to fight a just war. He never had any choice in the matter, nor was his dharma based on any particular personal qualities.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"As Cope then elaborates, in the traditional culture where this story was told, the very concept of an autonomous “personal self” didn’t exist."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This idea of dharma — or its equivalent — manifesting as a burden or responsibility that one takes on, not an energizing inclination, is common in the many cultural interpretations of the hero’s journey monomyth.&nbsp; Ancient wisdom, in other words, doesn’t so much prescribe that we follow our passion, as it does that we approach with passion the trials and responsibilities placed before us."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Modern career advice may be based on an incomplete translation of the underlying philosophies that sparked its emergence four decades earlier. For many, recognizing this reality is empowering. The belief that the world owes you the perfect role for your special unique personality is myopically self-focused and ill-suited to hard times. The alternative notion that the world needs you to offer all that you can is comparably liberating."}]},{"url":"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/06/08/answering-your-questions/","title":"Answering Your Questions","date":"2020/06/08","content":[{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1121972/4005569-ep-2-improving-concentration-influential-books-and-figuring-out-what-to-focus-on-deep-questions?client_source=small_player&amp;iframe=true&amp;referrer=https://www.buzzsprout.com/1121972/4005569-improving-concentration-influential-books-and-figuring-out-what-to-focus-on-deep-questions.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-4005569&amp;player=small\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Deep Questions with Cal Newport, Ep. 2: Improving Concentration, Influential Books, and Figuring Out What to Focus On | DEEP QUESTIONS\"></iframe>\n\n\n"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"<script src=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1121972/4005569-improving-concentration-influential-books-and-figuring-out-what-to-focus-on-deep-questions.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-4005569&amp;player=small\" type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"In the early years of this blog, one of my favorite activities was answering reader questions.

First, there was an obvious lack of common prioritization: Nobody was aware of every project, there was little consensus about which ones mattered most, and many projects overlapped or competed with others. Second, the system had too much work in process. Comparing the number of current projects with recent delivery history showed that employees had at least twice as much work as they could complete in the best of circumstances.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"By implementing a pull system that made all of the ongoing work transparent, and placing limits on work in progress, the Broad Institute was able to significantly improve the efficiency with which they completed projects."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"This shift from <em>push</em> to <em>pull</em> is just one idea among many that could help make better sense of the chaos that defines modern knowledge work. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed\">As I argued recently</a>, the time has come to start seeking these ideas.

His first response, after arriving broken in the underworld, is survival and progress. He makes his way out of Hades, perseveres&nbsp; through the trials that follow, and then once home, performs the work needed to get his life back in order."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"But then — and this is the key to the entire myth — he humbles himself on an inland journey, where he ritually moves beyond the easy comforts of his old life, laying the foundation on which to build something more meaningful."},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"Once it’s brought to our attention, this pattern becomes visible everywhere. We see it in the travails of Dante, and Augustine, and even Luke Skywalker.

We need WordPress-style sites featuring both easy-to-update static pages and chronological posts. These sites could be hosted by institutions with some degree of public trust and a reasonable technology infrastructure, such as universities, medical centers, and think tanks. Some mild gatekeeping could be performed on the experts granted blogs by these institutions, and critically, IT support could be provided so that the experts could start publishing with minimal overhead.”"},{"blockType":"paragraph","textContent":"I’m not sure if this particular idea will take hold or not.
